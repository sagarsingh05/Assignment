## **3. Accessibility in Web Development**
### **Definition:**

## **4. 3 Ways to Improve HTML Accessibility**
1. **Use Semantic HTML** – Elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>` improve readability for screen readers.  
2. **Provide Alt Text for Images** – `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">` helps visually impaired users.  
3. **Ensure Keyboard Navigation** – Make sure all functionalities work **without a mouse** (e.g., using `tab` key for navigation).
